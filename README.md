Pycasa
======

Pycasa is an image viewer application inspired by Google Picasa idea of simple
editor combined with image browers and viewer. Unlike Picasa where mouse is a must,
it provides more traditional, keystroke-oriented interface.
You might find it most useful for tasks involving massive image editing where tediouse
mouse operation can significantly slowdown process.
Typical usage often looks like this::

    todo...


Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. *Italics*, **bold**,
and ``monospace`` look like this.


A Section
=========

Lists look like this:

* First

* Second. Can be multiple lines
  but must be indented properly.

A Sub-Section
-------------

Numbered lists look like you'd expect:

1. hi there

2. must be going

Urls are http://like.this and links can be
written `like this <http://www.example.com/foo/bar>`_.
